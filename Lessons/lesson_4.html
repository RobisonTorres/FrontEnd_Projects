    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>

<!-- An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to
a server for processing. -->
    <form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org">

<!-- As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the
form element.-->
      <fieldset>

<!-- Specifying the type attribute of a form element is important for the browser to
know what kind of data it should expect. If the type is not specified, the browser will 
default to text. (within input)-->

<!-- To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to the input elements 
in the first fieldset. Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required 
fields, you will see an error message.-->

<!-- With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to provide each submittable
element with a name attribute. This attribute is used to identify the element in the form
submission.-->
        <label>Enter Your First Name: <input name="first-name"  type="text" required></label>
        <label>Enter Your Last Name: <input name="last-name" type="text" required></label>
        <label>Enter Your Email: <input name="email" type="email" required></label>

<!-- Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a minlength attribute
with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted.-->

<!-- Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the 
input match: [a-z0-5]{8,} The above is a regular expression which matches eight 
or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5.-->
        <label>Create a New Password: <input name="password" type="password" 
          required pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}"></label>
      </fieldset>    
      <fieldset>

<!-- You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not
know the radio inputs are related.-->

<!-- For the second fieldset, you want the input and label text to appear on the same line.-->
        <label><input type="radio" name="account-type" class="inline"> 
          Personal Account</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="account-type" class="inline"> 
          Business Account</label>

<!-- For the terms and conditions, add an input with a type of checkbox to the third 
label element. Also, as we do not want users to sign up, without having read the terms
and conditions, make it required.-->
        <label><input name="terms" type="checkbox" required class="inline"> I accept the
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/">
            terms and conditions</a></label>
      </fieldset>
      <fieldset>
        <label>Upload a profile picture: <input name="picture" type="file"></label>
        <label>Input your age (years): <input name="age" type="number" min="13" max="120"></label>
        <label>How did you hear about us?
          <select name=about-us>

<!--Submitting the form with an option selected would not send a useful value to the server. 
As such, each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, the text content
of the option will be submitted to the server.-->
            <option value="">(select one)</option>
            <option value="1">freeCodeCamp News</option>
            <option value="2">freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel</option>
            <option value="3">freeCodeCamp Forum</option>
            <option value="4">Other</option>  
          </select>
        </label>  

<!-- The textarea element acts like an input element of type text, but comes with the added 
benefit of being able to receive multi-line text, and an initial number of text rows 
and columns.-->        
        <label>Provide a bio:<textarea  name="bio" rows="3" cols="30" 
          placeholder="I like coding on the beach..."></textarea></label>
      </fieldset>

<!-- The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its 
nearest parent form element.-->
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
