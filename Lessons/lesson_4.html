    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>

<!-- An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to
a server for processing. -->
    <form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org">

<!-- As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the
form element.-->
      <fieldset></fieldset>

<!-- Specifying the type attribute of a form element is important for the browser to
know what kind of data it should expect. If the type is not specified, the browser will 
default to text. (within input)-->

<!-- To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to the input elements 
in the first fieldset. Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required 
fields, you will see an error message.-->
        <label>Enter Your First Name: <input type="text" required></label>
        <label>Enter Your Last Name: <input type="text" required></label>
        <label>Enter Your Email: <input type="email" required></label>

<!-- Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a minlength attribute
with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted.-->

<!-- Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the 
input match: [a-z0-5]{8,} The above is a regular expression which matches eight 
or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5.-->
        <label>Create a New Password: <input type="password" 
          required pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}"></label>
      <fieldset>

<!-- You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not
know the radio inputs are related.-->
        <label><input type="radio" name="account-type"> 
          Personal Account</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="account-type"> 
          Business Account</label>

<!-- For the terms and conditions, add an input with a type of checkbox to the third 
label element. Also, as we do not want users to sign up, without having read the terms
and conditions, make it required.-->
        <label><input type="checkbox" required>I accept the
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/">
            terms and conditions</a></label>
      </fieldset>
        <label>Upload a profile picture: <input type="file"></label>
      <fieldset></fieldset>

<!-- The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its 
nearest parent form element.-->
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
